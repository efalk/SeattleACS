Files for programming radios for Seattle Emergency Hub and ACS.

csv files are either for Chirp, or RT Systems software (Yaesu FT-60)

The RT Systems files might work on any RT Systems software. They has been
successfully tested with Explorer QRZ-1 and other radios. If you find a radio this
doesn't work with, feel free to contact me off line; I'll see what needs
to be changed.

Tools				Various programs to convert ICS217 spreadsheet to code plugs


My own preferred workflow is as follows:

• Download current radio settings into a tab within the software.
• Load the csv(s) into a second tab within the software.
• Copy-paste rows from the second tab into the tab for my radio.
• Upload back to the radio.

This process lets you store csv entries into whatever memories you like in the
radio, and lets you update the radio without losing other data. The "-s" option
is not needed if you do it this way.
