RT systems seems a bit flexible on the exact form of the CSV files it
can read. The names in the header line tell the software which each column is,
and columns can be omitted if not needed.

The two schemas shown here were exported from different devices.

<ch>			0-999			column header is blank, column ignored
Receive Frequency	146.96000
Transmit Frequency	146.36000		always present even for simplex
Offset Frequency	600 kHz | 5.0000 MHz
Offset Direction	Minus | Plus | Simplex
Operating Mode		FM | AM
Name			e.g. "PSRG"
Tone Mode		None | Tone
CTCSS			67.0			always present
Rx CTCSS		67.0			always present
DCS			023			always present
Rx DC			023			always present
DCS Polarity		023
Tx Power		High | Low
Skip			Y | N
Busy Lockout		(blank)
Comment			may be blank




From FT-60:
